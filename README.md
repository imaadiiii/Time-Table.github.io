This was my target image.

For this project Manipal Logo was needed, which i got on manipal website
As we can see in this image there are some course which are bold and marked with different colour.
The cells are not uniform when there is Lab in our time table, So for this I created two empty cell and then used colspan.
This was just my Short mini project on Html..!!
